## Object-Oriented Programming AY 2023-24 T1 // MAJOR COURSE OUTPUT

### INTRODUCTION
A role-playing game (RPG) is a game genre in which players advance through a main story
quest, and often multiple side quests, in order to gain in-game rewards such as items or
experience.

### PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The goal of the program is to catch and evolve creatures. The program starts by asking the
user to select one (1) evolutionary level 1 (i.e. EL1) starter creature, which is automatically
added to their inventory, and set as their active creature. Then, the user is shown the menu
screen, which contains the following OPTIONS : 

 1. [1] View Inventory
 2. [2] Explore an Area
 3. [3] Evolve Creature
 4. [4] Exit

### PROGRAM MILESTONES

The program milestones to keep track of the progress made for the machine project. This 
includes the necessary programming tasks, such as coding the machine's control software, 
implementing user interfaces, and conducting thorough software testing to ensure functionality 
and performance. This maybe changed as necessary especially as the project goes through.

## Milestone 2: Basic Game Framework - [x]

a. Implement the main game loop - [x]

b. Create the player class with attributes and methods - [x]

c. Develop the basic game menu structure - [x]

## Milestone 3: Starter Creature Selection - [x]

a. Implement the selection of an EL1 starter creature - [x]
