## Object-Oriented Programming AY 2023-24 T1 // MAJOR COURSE OUTPUT

### INTRODUCTION
A role-playing game (RPG) is a game genre in which players advance through a main story
quest, and often multiple side quests, in order to gain in-game rewards such as items or
experience.

### PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The goal of the program is to catch and evolve creatures. The program starts by asking the
user to select one (1) evolutionary level 1 (i.e. EL1) starter creature, which is automatically
added to their inventory, and set as their active creature. Then, the user is shown the menu
screen, which contains the following OPTIONS : 

 1. [1] View Inventory
 2. [2] Explore an Area
 3. [3] Evolve Creature
 4. [4] Exit
